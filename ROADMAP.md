- [ ] **Field definitions** - Map memory addresses to logical configuration fields
- [ ] **Data validation** - Implement bounds checking and logical validation
- [ ] **Variant profiles** - Support different actuator types with same interface

### Step 3.2: Configuration Editor Interface

- [ ] **Interactive config editor** - Menu-driven configuration modification

- [ ] **Bulk configuration** - Apply same settings to multiple actuators
- [ ] **Fleet management** - Track and manage actuator configurations

### Step 4.2: Advanced Diagnostics

- [ ] **Real-time monitoring** - Live position and status monitoring
- [ ] **Performance analysis** - Response time and accuracy measurements
- [ ] **Health monitoring** - Detect actuator degradation or issues

### Step 4.3: Integration Features

- [ ] **Configuration export/import** - Share configurations between users
- [ ] **Documentation generation** - Auto-generate setup documentation

## Risk Management & Safety üõ°Ô∏è

### Hardware Risks

- **Actuator bricking** - Always maintain multiple backup actuators
- **CAN bus damage** - Use current-limited interfaces, proper termination
- **Voltage compatibility** - Verify power supply requirements

### Software Risks

- **Memory corruption** - Implement checksum validation
- **Protocol errors** - Add robust error detection and recovery
- **Data loss** - Automated backup systems

### Development Strategy

- **Incremental testing** - Small changes, immediate validation
- **Parallel development** - Keep safe/dangerous operations separate
- **Community involvement** - Share findings, get feedback
- **Documentation focus** - Document everything for future developers

## Success Metrics üìä

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
